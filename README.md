Hello! I’m Vanessa! I have a Linguistics B.A. from CSU Northridge. During my time there, I took some computer science courses and a computational linguistics course. I’m interested in linguistics, computers, art, and video games. I’m currently learning Javascript and Python. I'm looking to continue my coding journey and add projects as I go. Reach me at vn.murillo@outlook.com!
